Hawaiian-IF.inform
==================

1)	Basic Story Outline that answers the following:

• Who is the player?

	Lilo
	
• Where is the player?

	She is on some of the Hawaiian Islands
	
• What does the player want/what is her ultimate goal?

	Her main goal is to 1) find & take the key to open the cabinet 2) find Stitch’s soul mate
	
• What are the obstacles that must be overcome to achieve the ultimate goal?

	Distract the dog → you can take the key from him, and figure out a way to bribe Kehau (Stitch’s soul mate) to come with you to meet Stitch.
• 
Describe the obstacles and what the player needs to do to overcome them.
	
	To distract the dog: Go to Hale Ku’ai (a store on O’ahu), and take Munch Bones → give the Munch Bones to the ‘ilio → he will get distracted, therefore, you will be able to take the key without him noticing
	To bribe Kehau to come with you: in your inventory, you have a Special Photo.  This photo is a picture of Stitch, when you show Kehau the picture → she will fall in love with him and be in your possession. 

• How does the IF end? What action triggers the end of story?

	The IF ends when you have BOTH: key, and Kehau. 

• What other endings are there?

	No other endings

2) Responses to the following questions:

• Other than to complete an assignment, what did you want to accomplish by creating this IF?

	I wanted to create a fun, interesting, yet simple game for people to be able to play.  I wanted to have a different kind of answer to a problem you had in the story (giving the treat to the dog in order to distract him.)

• How well does this IF accomplish what you set out to do?

	By some of the feedback I received, I think it went very well.  However, I could’ve made the game a bit more difficult.

• Discuss in detail a time when you got stuck, and how you got unstuck.

	I got stuck when I was trying to end the game.  I had an error that I couldn’t end it by saying to end the game → Lilo needed to have the Key and Kehau.  Mrs. Kiang helped me.

• Tell of a time a classmate helped you and of a time you were able to help a classmate.

	Tatiana Fudo helped me by showing and explaining how to add the clipart to my Release.  I was able to help some of my other classmates by telling them how to make their clipart smaller, so it would look nicer on the browser.

• Discuss the gameplay mechanics in your IF and how they improve the user's experience. Think of the changes you made in your story ideas and/or puzzles during the course of creating this IF.

	Instead of making a simple problem, I made a more complex problem by using an object for different purposes.  You had to be more creative, and think outside of the box to win the game/collect the items you needed.

3) Beta testing

• Whose IF did you test?  What valuable feedback were you able to give them? 

	I tested Izzy’s IF.  I was able to let her know that some of the exits given did not work, and that some of the objects described did not make sense.

• Who beta tested your IF? How did their feedback help you with your own IF?

	Izzy tested my IF.  She was able to tell me that she was able to take things that shouldn’t have been able to take.

4) Inform

• Consider your whole experience with Inform.

~ What do you like about programming with Inform?

	I liked that it was coding similar to how we normally talk, and understanding the different ways/forms you had to say things.

~ What was challenging about programming with Inform?

	It was challenging when I kept getting errors and I didn’t know why.  It was frustrating when it was something very small such as a spelling error.

~ What resources were the most useful for the questions you had about Inform?

	Mrs. Kiang, and other classmates.

~ What advice would you give to someone just starting to learn Inform?

	Take your time, go through things slowly, make sure you save other IF reforms so you can use it for future ones.

~ What are you most proud of regarding your programming abilities and projects, so far?

	I think its cool that we learned how to upload our IF to a browser and add graphics.
